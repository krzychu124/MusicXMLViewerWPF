# MusicXMLViewerWPF
If you want to do something, just DO IT! ;)

First project in C#, bigger than calculator ;)

Maybe too ambitious and quite challenging but I like challenges :)

_I started this for Learning C# and WPF... Might be highly unreadable sometimes(sometimes whole pages) :/_

If you are brave, you can check it, but first make sure if you are ready to see:
*   tons of commented lines
*   test methods and ideas
*   not intuitive and complicated parts of code
*   problems everywhere ;)

**_Everything here is an experiment here so everything could be changed in the future and will be for sure._**

Main goal of project is to learn/improve C# and WPF by programming something which:
-  should work
-  hopefully look like "simple" music score editor
-  and of course be useful somehow 

**Currently under developement:**       60-70% Done.  ~~Works quite good but that's not enough for me.~~ 
   - [x] ~~MusicXML reader // quite time consuming to implement // Absolute minimum to represent notes //~~ **Done**

   - [ ] **Under Developement** Methods for drawing  // Complete refactoring
 
**Next: (have to learn this first):**  0% only ideas for now :/

   - [ ] Basic interaction with drawn/loaded Music Score

**Then:**                                               
  - [ ] Saving changes made on loaded Music Score back to MusicXML file // Serialization?? I have to check it later ;) 
    
**At the end:**  
  - [ ] Add each object using only mouse 
  - [ ] Maybe simple printing to PDF, XPS or something else
 
**Sorry for my English if someting is not understandable**
