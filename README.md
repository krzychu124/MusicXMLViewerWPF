# MusicXMLViewerWPF
First project in C# ;)

_Made for Learning C# and WPF... Might be highly unreadable sometimes(sometimes whole pages) :/_

A lot of commented lines, test methods, ideas and even more.
```diff
+Update ==> Refactoring to MVVM
```

**_Everything here is an experiment so everything could be changed in the future and will be for sure._**

**Currently (partialy) implemented (under developenent):**       50-60% Done.  Works quite good but that's not enough for me. 
   - [x] MusicXML reader // quite time consuming to implement // Absolute minimum to represent notes done // 

   - [x] Methods for drawing  //surprisingly good, taking into account my experience // I have few improvement ideas // 
 
**Ideas to implement at first place (have to learn that first):**  0% only ideas for now :/

   - [ ] Basic interaction with drawn objects

**Next:**                                               
  - [ ] Saving things which were edited back to MusicXML file // Serialization?? I have to check it later ;) 
    
**Hardest for now:**  
  - [ ] Add each object using only mouse 
  - [ ] Maybe simple printing to PDF, XPS or something else
