# MusicXMLViewerWPF

**Hello Stranger,**

I don't know how did you get here but if you are brave, you can check it out.
```diff
-Spagetti code warning !!!
```

**_Everything here is an experiment here so everything could be changed completely in the future._**
#### Main goal of this project is learn/improve _C#_ by programming something bigger than calculator.
---
I hope this program:
-  will work as expected
-  hopefully look like "_simple_" music score editor
-  and of course be useful somehow

###**Currently under developement:**
   - [x] ~~MusicXML reader // quite time consuming to implement // Absolute minimum to represent notes //~~ **Done**
   - [ ] **MusicXML Reader** - improvements
   - [ ] **Refactoring project according to MVVM pattern**
   - [ ] **BasicUI Layout**

###**Next:**

   - [ ] Basic interaction with drawn/loaded Music Score

###**Then:**                                               
  - [ ] Saving changes made on loaded Music Score back to MusicXML file // Serialization?? I have to check it later ;) 
    
###**At the end:**  
  - [ ] Add each object using only mouse 
  - [ ] Maybe simple printing to PDF, XPS or something else
