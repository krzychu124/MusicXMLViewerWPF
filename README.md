# MusicXMLViewerWPF
First project in C#, bigger than calculator ;)

I read somewhere that when you want to code, just start doing that.

_I started this for Learning C# and WPF... Might be highly unreadable sometimes(sometimes whole page) ;)_

A lot of commented lines, test methods, ideas and even more problems and issues, but that's the key if you want to learn something, I think :)

**_Everything here is an experiment so everything could be changed in the future and will be for sure._**

It's good to have any goals of project so main is to learn C# and WPF better and make something which will work and look like simple music score editor.

**Currently (partialy) implemented (under developenent):**       50-60% Done.  Works quite good but that's not enough for me ;) 
   - [x] MusicXML reader // quite time consuming to implement // Absoule minimum to represent notes done // 

   - [x] Methods for drawing  //surprisingly good, taking into account my experience // I have few improvement ideas // 
 
**Ideas to implement at first place (have to learn that first ;) ):**  0% only ideas for now ;) 

   - [ ] Basic interaction with drawn objects

**Next:**                                               
  - [ ] Saving things which were edited back to MusicXML file // Serialization?? I have to check it later ;) 
    
**Hardest for now:**  
  - [ ] Add each object using only mouse :)
  - [ ] Maybe simple printing to PDF, XPS or something else ;)
 
**Sorry for my English if someting is not understandable** // It's not as good as I want:)
