# MusicXMLViewerWPF

**Hello Stranger,**

I don't know how did you find this but if you are brave, you can check it out.

**_Everything here is an experiment here so everything could be changed in the future and will be for sure._**
#### Main goal of this project is learn/improve _C#_ by programming something bigger than calculator.
---
I hope this program:
-  will work
-  hopefully look like "_simple_" music score editor
-  and of course be useful somehow

**Currently under developement:**       60-70% Done.  ~~Works quite good but that's not enough for me.~~ 
   - [x] ~~MusicXML reader // quite time consuming to implement // Absolute minimum to represent notes //~~ **Done**

   - [ ] **Under Developement** Methods for drawing  // Complete refactoring // A lot more complicated than i thought :)
 
**Next: (have to learn this first):**  0% only ideas for now :/

   - [ ] Basic interaction with drawn/loaded Music Score

**Then:**                                               
  - [ ] Saving changes made on loaded Music Score back to MusicXML file // Serialization?? I have to check it later ;) 
    
**At the end:**  
  - [ ] Add each object using only mouse 
  - [ ] Maybe simple printing to PDF, XPS or something else
 
**Sorry for my English if someting is not understandable**
